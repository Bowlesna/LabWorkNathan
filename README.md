This journal will be recording work involving my contribution to the project of better understanding the spatial distribution of the two types of kernel in an ear of corn. By ‘types of kernel’, we mean whether or not the kernel contains a certain fluorescent property. Previous work hypotheses that there is a 1-1 relationship between the two.
